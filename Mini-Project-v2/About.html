            <h1>Hello! </h1>
            <p>My name is Kaylee Gourley.
                <br>
                Im a fourth year graphic design student, originally from Northern Alberta.

        <h2>My About</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a fourth-year graphic design student at Vancouver Island University, and creativity has been my lifelong
            companion. Painting and crochet have always been my go-to outlets for self-expression, weaving together
            colors
            and textures to create something truly unique.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout my time at VIU, I've immersed myself in the world of graphic design, blending traditional
            techniques
            with modern digital tools to bring my ideas to fruition. My peers and professors recognize my dedication and
            passion for the craft, which drives me to continually push the boundaries of my creativity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to dive into the fast-paced realm of branding and marketing. For me, design isn't just
            about
            making things look prettyâ€”it's about crafting narratives and evoking emotions that resonate with audiences
            on a
            deeper level.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Beyond my studies, I'm always seeking new ways to express myself artistically. Whether I'm experimenting with
            color schemes or exploring the latest design trends, I approach every project with boundless enthusiasm and
            a
            fresh perspective.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As I prepare to graduate, I'm excited to channel my skills and passion into making a tangible impact in the
            branding and marketing industry. With my knack for storytelling and eye for detail, I'm confident that I can
            create visual identities that captivate and inspire.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In my downtime, you'll find me fully immersed in my latest creative endeavors, eager to explore the endless
            possibilities that art and design have to offer.</p>
